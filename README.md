A lottery result checking app which was scrapped when apps better than mine comes out and I couldn't keep up development with a full time job. I decided to open-source the app as an educational purpose material.

### What can I learn?

A lot of cool stuffs in the app like

* Clean architecture
* MVP
* Feature-based modules
* Arch Navigation
* AdMob
* And a lot more

### Contribution

I'm more than happy to point out my errors and also improve the structure.  Feel free to open issue to dicuss anything related to the code. Note that this will **never be released** on play store and will be just left as educational code.
